World "Basics"
Level 2
Title "Inverse of inverse"

Introduction "
In this level, you'll use a `calc` proof to show $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$, for every
$a$ in a group $G$.

**Remember** enter `\\-1` to produce `⁻¹`.

You will need to add more lines of the calculation. Each line should take the form
`_ = expr := by rw [fact]`, where `fact` is the name of the definition or theorem you are using
and `expr` is some mathematical expression.

/--
`inv_inv (b : G) h` is the proof of `b = 1` if `h` is the hypothesis
`h :  ∀ (a : G), b * a = a`.

This is uniqueness of (left) identity in a group.
