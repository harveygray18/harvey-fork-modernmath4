Title "Uniqueness of inverse"

Introduction "
In a previous level, you showed uniqueness of identity. Now we will show uniqueness of inverses.

That is, you've prove that if $a * b = 1$ then $a^{-1} = b$.

Below is a template proof. Replace the `sorry` in the editor pane with this template.
To complete the proof, fill in the `sorry` placeholders.

```
calc
  a⁻¹ = sorry   := by sorry
  _ =  sorry    := by sorry
  _ =  sorry    := by sorry
  _ =  sorry    := by sorry
  _ = b         := by sorry
```

`inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one (h : a * b = 1)` is the proof that `a⁻¹ = b`.

This is the uniqueness of inverses.
