Title "Multiplicative identity on the left"

Introduction "
In the previous level, we saw that $a * 1 = a$ for every $a$ in a group $G$. In this level, we
introduce the property that $1 * a = a$, for every $a$ in $G$.

  rw [mul_one]

Conclusion "
I asked you to perform rewrites on two separate lines. But these rewrites can be combined on one
line as `rw [mul_one, one_mul]`.

In the next level, we'll learn another property of groups.
