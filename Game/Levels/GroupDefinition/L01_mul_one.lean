Title "Multiplicative identity"

Introduction "
A group $G$ is a set together with an operation $*$ and a distinguished element $1$, not
necessarily the same as the natural number $1$, that satisfies certain properties. We'll introduce
these properties in the next few levels. The first property, called `mul_one` asserts that
$a * 1 = a$.

To complete this level, just enter `rw [mul_one]` in the box in the middle pane.

*Note* `rw` is am abbreviation for the `rewrite` tactic. We use it to rewrite the target
`a * 1 = a` to the target `a = a` and thereby complete the proof.
"

/-- `rw` is used to rewrite the target or a hypothesis

If `h` is the name of a theorem `rw [h]` rewrites the target using `h`. For example, if `h` is
the theroem `a = b`, then `rw [h]` causes every instance of `a` in the target to be replaced with
`b`.

Conclusion "
Great, you've just used the right identity property of groups. We'll learn the left identity property
in the next level.
